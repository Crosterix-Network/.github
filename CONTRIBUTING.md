## 🧱 Workflow

- Use **Conventional Commits** for all commits:
  - `feat:` → new feature  
  - `fix:` → bug fix  
  - `docs:` → documentation changes  
  - `chore:` → tooling or maintenance
- Create branches as `feature/<short-name>` or `fix/<short-name>`.
- Open Pull Requests (PR) → target **develop** branch.
- After review and test pass → merged into **main**.
- All PRs **must** pass lint and test checks.
